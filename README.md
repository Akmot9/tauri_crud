# Tauri CRUD Example

Welcome to the Tauri CRUD Example repository!

This project demonstrates how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Tauri, a framework for building desktop applications with web technologies, and Rust's Rusqlite library for the embedded database. The main focus is on creating a simple desktop application with Tauri that interacts with a local SQLite database.
